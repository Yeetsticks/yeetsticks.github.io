            <h1>Home</h1>
            <p>So uhh I got a webpage... on the interwebs B)</p>
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My code is always a mess, including this very html. I mainly code in python and like to play a 
                few games, mainly rhythm games such as BeatSaber and FNF <br/>
                <br/>
                Now you may be wondering... <b>Why create a webpage?</b> <br/>
                Here's a counter question: <b>Why not create a webpage??</b><br/><br/>
                My question has 2 question marks so therefore it's better and creating webpages is cool and stuff. <br/>

                <h2>Why my opinions are correct</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have already noticed, but on the off chance you hadn't yet: My opinions are objectively good. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 1px; text-align: center;">definitely not writing this at 1am</span> <br/>
            </p> 
            <h2>Seriously though, why make this?</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment I'm doing a course based off of cyber security and researching similar subjects for a better understanding
                but the rabbit hole eventually led to me revisiting html and hosting this on github. <br/>
                Will I put anything of use here? No. <br/>
                Will I update this webpage? Probably not. <br/><br/>

                Anyways... if there's anything else to this website feel free to take a look
